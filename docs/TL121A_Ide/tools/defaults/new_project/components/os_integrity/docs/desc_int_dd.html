<h3>INTEGRITY Dynamic Download</h3>
<hr SIZE="1" NOSHADE>
<p>
A Dynamic Download image consists of one or more virtual AddressSpace
projects that are downloaded via MULTI onto an INTEGRITY kernel already
running on your target. Use a Dynamic Download INTEGRITY Application Project
to bundle related virtual AddressSpaces without linking in a kernel project,
so it can be downloaded independently.
